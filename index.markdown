I am a student at [MINES ParisTech](https://www.minesparis.psl.eu/) - [PSL University](https://psl.eu) (France).
I am preparing its top-ranking Master's Degree in Science & Executive Engineering (exp. grad. May 2023).
I am interested in Data Science, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Probabilities and Statistics.

My favorite book of the moment: *Applied Probability and Statistical Methods*, by George C. Canavos (1984)
