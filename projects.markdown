In this page you will find all the projects I have been working on, alone or with a team. They involve Maths, Computer Science, but also Physics, Economics, etc. Some of them are just side-projects.

# Current

* **starting Dec. 2021**: a trimester-long project in embedded systems and cyber-physical systems.
* **since Feb. 2021**: (side-project) I am currently writing a document on Integration and Probabilities (~kind of lectures notes). I decided to write it because I had the impression that the Differential, Integral and Stochastic Calculus course I attented in Fall 2020 did not go deep enough. I work on it from time to time, and eventually I would like it to have a large amount of examples and exercises. [GitHub repo](https://github.com/cesar-alm/math-et-al)

# 2021

* **October-November 2021**: a collaboration between MINES ParisTech and the [CNSMDP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatoire_de_Paris) (the Paris Conservatory). Our objective: using VR, help the conservatory enhance their ambisonic sound system (prevent the auditory-visual conflict caused by the sound system). In particular, I was in charge of the user studies (data science evaluating the performance of our product). [Poster](/assets/movie_poster.pdf) &#124; [Report](/assets/movie_paper.pdf)
* **September-November 2021**: a series of numerical projects in a Deep Learning course at MINES ParisTech. [GitHub repo](https://github.com/cesar-alm/deep-learning)
* **June 2021**: worked on a numerical project in Data Science (Jupyter Notebook and Python): trained classifier models to identify predominant tree species in 30x30m zones. Got an F-Score of 0.922 (top 10% of the students). [GitHub repo](https://github.com/cesar-alm/projet-sdd)
* **June 2021**: month-long project on nickel-based alloys used for turbine blades. Studied the fabrication process and the microstructure. [Report (poster)](/assets/mpi_poster.pdf)
* **June 2021**: studied - through a practical work - the influence of a thermomecanical process on a stainless austenitic steel. [Report](/assets/mpi_rapport.pdf)
* **May-June 2021**: worked on a rogue-based game, relying on python, flask, html, css and js. [GitHub repo](https://github.com/LouisJustinTALLOT/projet-web-intro-et-network-intro-les-fourmis)
* **May 2021**: wrote an Economics paper on the [digital euro](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/other/Report_on_a_digital_euro~4d7268b458.en.pdf). [Report](assets/eco_article.pdf)
* **Spring 2021**: semester-long research project with a Ph.D. student in [Physical Internet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_Internet). Our objective: apply in Paris the logistical innovations Physical Internet provides, in order to minimize pollution and traffic jams. What we did: retrieved open-data files of all the locations in Paris (and its region) that need logistical supplies (stores, hotels, restaurants, etc.). Then, we found the best warehouses locations (K-Means, roughly). [GitHub repo](https://github.com/LouisJustinTALLOT/UE22-projet-ecosysteme-logistique)
* **April 2021**: worked on a numerical project for the Optimization course. Optimized the water distribution in a complex network. [GitHub repo](https://github.com/cesar-alm/opti-project)
* **April 2021**: worked on a numerical project for the Signal Processing course. Studied 3 different implementations of a derivative filter (finite differences, state observer and the Savitzki-Golay filter). [GitHub repo](https://github.com/cesar-alm/traits-project)
* **February 2021**: worked on a numerical project in Stochastic Calculus: estimated the length (expectancy, sd, etc.) of a submarine cable having only little information about the real depth of the sea. [GitHub repo](https://github.com/cesar-alm/projet-probas)
* **January 2021**: worked on a project about the numerical solving of the Lotka-Volterra differential equations. In particular, compared the result given by the standard Euler method and the backward Euler method. [GitHub repo](https://github.com/cesar-alm/projet_eqdiff)

# 2020
* **December 2020**: Anthropology project based on Nastassja Martin's book *Les âmes sauvages: Face à l'Occident, la résistance d'un peuple d'Alaska* (2016). [Presentation given on 1/11/2021](/assets/qse_presentation.pdf)
* **November 2020**: took part in a collaboration between France’s largest hospital [Hôpital de la Pitié-Salpêtrière](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piti%C3%A9-Salp%C3%AAtri%C3%A8re_Hospital) and MINES ParisTech. Helped two infectiologists adapt to chronic diseases the French telehealth service for COVID-19 *Covidom*. Led a team of four students whose objective was to simulate the COVID-19 pandemic evolution in France, considering the government’s vaccination strategy.

* **October 2020**: worked on a numerical project in Calculus, about level curves. [GitHub repo](https://github.com/cesar-alm/projetnum_cdiff)
* **Fall 2020**: semester-long project on urban mines and recycling. We tried to answer the following question: could France only rely on copper extracted from urban mines (recycling), and become autonomous in copper? Using numerical simulations, we concluded that it is not possible (even with a reasoned use of copper in the next 30 years). [Report (poster)](https://robingirard.github.io/MINES-UE14-miniprojet/Past/2020/Posters/UE142020-S14.pdf) &#124; [GitHub repo of the simulation](https://github.com/LouisJustinTALLOT/simulations-projet-ue14)
* **Spring 2020**: research project on bubble curtains. We tried to prove that they would be efficient to protect the submarine wildlife against loud noise. *Aborted project due to the COVID-19 pandemic.* [Bibliographic report](/assets/tipe_mcot.pdf)

# 2019

* **Spring 2019**: research paper in Pure Maths on fractals and space-filling curves. We studied the Mandelbrot set and its sister the Julia set, the Koch snowflake, the Hausdorff dimension theory, and a space-filling curve. [Paper](/assets/tipe_paper.pdf)

# Older

* **2015-2018**: (side-project) a Java plugin for [Minecraft](https://www.minecraft.net). Transforms the original game in a trading card game (such as [Magic](https://magic.wizards.com/)). The game system works, what is left is to add all the cards! [GitHub repo](https://github.com/cesar-alm/tga)
