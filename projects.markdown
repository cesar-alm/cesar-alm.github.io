In this page you will find all the projects I have been working on (maths, computer science, side projects, etc.)

# Current

* **since Sept. 2021**: this very website. [GitHub repo](https://github.com/cesar-alm/cesar-alm.github.io)
* **since Feb. 2021**: (side-project) I am currently writing a document on Integration and Probabilities (~kind of lectures notes). I decided to write it because I had the impression that the Differential, Integral and Stochastic Calculus course I attented in Fall 2020 did not go deep enough. I work on it from time to time, and eventually I would like it to have a large amount of examples and exercises. [GitHub repo](https://github.com/cesar-alm/math-et-al)

# 2021

* **Spring 2021**: semester-long research project with a Ph.D. student in [Physical Internet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_Internet). Our objective: apply in Paris the logistical innovations Physical Internet provides, in order to minimize pollution and traffic jams. What we did: retrieved open-data files of all the locations in Paris (and its region) that need logistical supplies (stores, hotels, restaurants, etc.). Then, we found the best warehouses locations (K-Means, roughly). [GitHub repo](https://github.com/LouisJustinTALLOT/UE22-projet-ecosysteme-logistique)
* **June 2021**: worked on a numerical project in Data Science (Jupyter Notebook and Python): trained classifier models to identify predominant tree species in 30x30m zones. Got an F-Score of 0.922 (top 10% of the students). [GitHub repo](https://github.com/cesar-alm/projet-sdd)
